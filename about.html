   <p>
We want to give our students enough knowledge to create interacive web pages so that they can develop their own interesting projects, without overwhelming them or boring them with too much information.We work hard to find that sweet spot!</p>

<p>We give them tools to become independent problem solvers-- to find/figure out code on their own once they have left the program.</p>

<p>We include breaks, hands-on learning activities and field trips.
   </p>
   
   <p>Our instructors are (amazing) current UM science and engineering undergraduate students and one who just graduated in May (congratulations Rebecca! and tears).</p>
